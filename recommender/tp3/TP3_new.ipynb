    "PageRank is decomposed in several steps:\n",
    "- Create a toy dataset\n",
    "- Build the item graph\n",
    "- Implement PageRank\n",
    "- Run PageRank on the dataset to validate its behavior\n",
    "- Implement a recommender based on the PageRank\n",
    "- Adapt the MovieLens validation to use Recall as a validation metric\n",
    "- Compare it to other approches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a toy dataset\n",
    "In MovieLens, we know what movies users have seen and how they rated them. For each user, we know when the movie has been seen and what is the rating he gave to it. There are lot of questions here:\n",
    "- directed on undirected? We have the timestamp of movies so we could have directed edges based on time.\n",
    "- threshold or not? Even if a user has disliked a movie, he has seen it so it means it matched his interests. Do we want to show movies the user could find interesting, or movies that he would like?\n",
    "- time window? Should we create links between all the movies a user has seen, or only some of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "But, for now, we are only interested in the technical function of PageRank. Create a small dataset on which you will be able to iterate fast."
