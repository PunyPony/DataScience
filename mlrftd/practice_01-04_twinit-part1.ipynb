    "### Image borders and padding\n",
    "You will need a little trick to be able to perform pattern matching on images which have approximately the same size: you will have to pad the base image (one of the two bubble being matched) in order to cope with possible texture translation. You can use the function [`cv2.copyMakeBorder()`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#ga2ac1049c2c3dd25c2b41bffe17658a36).\n",
    "The goal is to ensure that the base image has borders large enough to contain the largest patterns (both horizontally and vertically).\n",
    "\n",
    "As image border is an important concept, we will illustrate the possible borders values before going further.\n",
    "This section is copied from the [original OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d3/df2/tutorial_py_basic_ops.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `cv2.copyMakeBorder()` takes following arguments:\n",
    "- `src`: input image\n",
    "- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`: border width in number of pixels in corresponding directions\n",
    "- `borderType`: Flag defining what kind of border to be added. It can be following types:\n",
    "   - `cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT`: Adds a constant colored border, like this: `xxxxx|abcdefgh|xxxxx`. The value should be given as next argument.\n",
    "   - `cv2.BORDER_REFLECT`: Border will be mirror reflection of the border elements, like this: `fedcba|abcdefgh|hgfedcb`\n",
    "   - `cv2.BORDER_REFLECT_101` or `cv.BORDER_DEFAULT`: Same as above, but with a slight change, like this: `gfedcb|abcdefgh|gfedcba`\n",
    "   - `cv2.BORDER_REPLICATE`: Last element is replicated throughout, like this: `aaaaaa|abcdefgh|hhhhhhh`\n",
    "   - `cv2.BORDER_WRAP`: Circular copy of the rows and columns from the other side of the image, like this: `cdefgh|abcdefgh|abcdefg`\n",
    "- `value` - Color of border if border type is `cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT`\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a sample code demonstrating all these border types for better understanding:\n",
    "```python\n",
