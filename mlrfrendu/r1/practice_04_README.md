## Warning: resource location
We stored the resources you need for this session under `/afs/cri.epita.net/resources/teach/bigdata/mlrf19/INRIA_Holidays_shuffled`.


## Warning: environment configuration
To avoid space issues related with PIP installation, and to be able to reuse your work environment between sessions, you need to:
1. Execute **only once** (do not relaunch it if you already did it in the past) the following script: `/afs/cri.epita.net/resources/teach/bigdata/install.sh`
2. Execute **everytime you start a new session** the following script: `/afs/cri.epita.net/resources/teach/bigdata/configure.sh`


## Getting started
This session uses the following Jupyter notebooks:
- `practice_04-00_intro.ipynb`
- `practice_04-01_BoVW.ipynb`

To start working, launch a terminal and navigate to the content of this archive.
Then, run [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/):
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

Of course, you need to make sure all the required modules are installed.
You can install then all, **for your current user only,** using the following command:
```shell
pip install --user -r practice_04_requirements.txt
```

Then, open the first notebook: `practice_04-00_intro.ipynb`.
